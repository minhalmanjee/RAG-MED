# 🏥 RBAC-based RAG Medical Chatbot

A secure healthcare chatbot that leverages **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to deliver medical information safely. Using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, it combines vector-based document retrieval with large language models (LLMs) to provide accurate, context-aware answers while ensuring sensitive medical data is only accessible to authorized roles such as **Doctors**, **Nurses**, **Patients**, and **Admins**.  

This system is designed for healthcare platforms where privacy and role-sensitive access are critical, making it ideal for clinical support, patient queries, and administrative management.
